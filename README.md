The website for PhatTime: The Learning Network

## Development
Currently this is a static site.  Dev dependencies are copied into place by npm postInstall and committed to the repo.
However,  you can repeat the process by running from the project root:

    npm install
    
The caveat is that this is Windows specific right now.  That will be addressed.
